# Overview

Coding club exercises.  Each exercise is tagged, so check out the releases.

## Installation instructions

```shell
> yarn; yarn run develop
> cd dist; ../node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server
```

At this point you should see that a webserver is running on port 8080, so in your browser open:

http://localhost:8080

If all is working well you should see the exercise.  Check the checkboxes to attach the observers to the subject.
